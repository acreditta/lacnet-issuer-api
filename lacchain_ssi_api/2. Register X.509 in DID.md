## Bind an X.509 certificate to a DID

This tutorial describes the steps to register and bind an X.509 certificate as a Verification Method of a DID using the command line tool (did-cli).

### Pre-requisites

- **did-cli**: to see how to install and run the CLI tool go to the official repository https://github.com/lacchain/did-cli
- **openssl**: depending on the OS, check the version needed https://www.openssl.org/source/

### Generate X.509 certificate

**Note:** If you have already one X.509 RSA certificate key-pair, skip this section (you may only need the Public Key).

To generate a new X.509 RSA certificate execute the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt
```

Then a form will appear to fill with the entity related data:

![Generate X.509](./images/x509_generate.png)

This will generate two files (in PEM format):

- **private.key**: Private Key file
- **certificate.crt**: Public Key file

### Add Verification Method

To bind the X.509 in the DID, you need to add new Verification Method to the DID. You can perform this operation using the did-cli tool.

Fist, select the option **List (View all DIDs)**,  to view the DIDs that you have already created:

![List DID Step 1](./images/list_did_step1.png)

Then, choose the desired DID to bind the X.509 certificate:

Now, select the option **Add Verification Method** to start the process for registering a new VM in the selected DID:

![Add VM Step 1](./images/add_vm_step1.png)

Here you can choose the [Verification Relationship](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-relationships), in this example you can select the **assertionMethod** because this is the most common use of an X.509 certificate.

If you do not have or did not generate an X.509 certificate, here it is possible to choose the option to generate a key pair automatically. However, in this example type "Y":

The [W3C DID specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#verification-method-types), define a set of algorithms for Verification Methods. For an X.509 certificate select **RsaVerificationKey2018**:

Commonly, an X.509 certificate is encoded using a PEM format, so that will be the option that you should select:

Then, you need to specify the Public Key file path:

![Add VM Step 6](./images/add_vm_step6.png)

Optionally, you can specify the Private Key file path:

![Add VM Step 7](./images/add_vm_step7.png)

Every Verification Method must have an expiration date, in this example 31536000 corresponds to one year.

![Add VM Step 8](./images/add_vm_step8.png)

Finally you need to assign a controller to the new Verification Method.

As a result of the process, the CLI will show the blockchain transaction hash.

![Add VM Step 10](./images/add_vm_step10.png)

If you press any key to continue, the tool will show the new VM in the list:
